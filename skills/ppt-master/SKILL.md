# PPT Master Skill

> AI-driven multi-format SVG content generation system. Converts source documents into high-quality SVG pages through multi-role collaboration and exports to PPTX.

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → Template Option → Strategist → [Image_Generator] → Executor → Post-processing → Export`

> [!CAUTION]
> ## 🚨 Global Execution Discipline (MANDATORY)
>
> **This workflow is a strict serial pipeline. The following rules have the highest priority — violating any one of them constitutes execution failure:**
>
> 1. **SERIAL EXECUTION** — Steps MUST be executed in order; the output of each step is the input for the next. Non-BLOCKING adjacent steps may proceed continuously once prerequisites are met, without waiting for the user to say "continue"
> 2. **BLOCKING = HARD STOP** — Steps marked ⛔ BLOCKING require a full stop; the AI MUST wait for an explicit user response before proceeding and MUST NOT make any decisions on behalf of the user
> 3. **NO CROSS-PHASE BUNDLING** — Cross-phase bundling is FORBIDDEN. (Note: the Eight Confirmations in Step 4 are ⛔ BLOCKING — the AI MUST present recommendations and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding. Once the user confirms, all subsequent non-BLOCKING steps — design spec output, SVG generation, speaker notes, and post-processing — may proceed automatically without further user confirmation)
> 4. **GATE BEFORE ENTRY** — Each Step has prerequisites (🚧 GATE) listed at the top; these MUST be verified before starting that Step
> 5. **NO SPECULATIVE EXECUTION** — "Pre-preparing" content for subsequent Steps is FORBIDDEN (e.g., writing SVG code during the Strategist phase)
> 6. **NO SUB-AGENT SVG GENERATION** — Executor Step 6 SVG generation is context-dependent and MUST be completed by the current main agent end-to-end. Delegating page SVG generation to sub-agents is FORBIDDEN
> 7. **SEQUENTIAL PAGE GENERATION ONLY** — In Executor Step 6, after the global design context is confirmed, SVG pages MUST be generated sequentially page by page in one continuous pass. Grouped page batches (for example, 5 pages at a time) are FORBIDDEN
> 8. **SPEC_LOCK RE-READ PER PAGE** — Before generating each SVG page, Executor MUST `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md`. All colors / fonts / icons / images MUST come from this file — no values from memory or invented on the fly. Executor MUST also look up the current page's `page_rhythm` tag and apply the matching layout discipline (`anchor` / `dense` / `breathing` — see executor-base.md §2.1). This rule exists to resist context-compression drift on long decks and to break the uniform "every page is a card grid" default

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🌐 Language & Communication Rule
>
> - **Response language**: match the user's input and source materials. Explicit user override (e.g., "请用英文回答") takes precedence.
> - **Template format**: `design_spec.md` MUST follow its original English template structure (section headings, field names) regardless of conversation language. Content values may be in the user's language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🔌 Compatibility With Generic Coding Skills
>
> - `ppt-master` is a repository-specific workflow, not a general application scaffold
> - Do NOT create `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, branch workflows, or generic engineering structure by default
> - On conflict with a generic coding skill, follow this skill unless the user explicitly says otherwise

## Main Pipeline Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/pdf_to_md.py` | PDF to Markdown |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/doc_to_md.py` | Documents to Markdown — native Python for DOCX/HTML/EPUB/IPYNB, pandoc fallback for legacy formats (.doc/.odt/.rtf/.tex/.rst/.org/.typ) |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/excel_to_md.py` | Excel workbooks to Markdown — supports .xlsx/.xlsm; legacy .xls should be resaved as .xlsx |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/ppt_to_md.py` | PowerPoint to Markdown |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/web_to_md.py` | Web page to Markdown |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/web_to_md.cjs` | Node.js fallback for WeChat / TLS-blocked sites (use only if `curl_cffi` is unavailable; `web_to_md.py` now handles WeChat when `curl_cffi` is installed) |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py` | Project init / validate / manage |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py` | Image analysis |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_gen.py` | AI image generation (multi-provider) |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py` | SVG quality check |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/total_md_split.py` | Speaker notes splitting |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/finalize_svg.py` | SVG post-processing (unified entry) |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py` | Export to PPTX |
| `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/update_spec.py` | Propagate a `spec_lock.md` color / font_family change across all generated SVGs |

For complete tool documentation, see `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/README.md`.

## Template Index

| Index | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Layout templates | `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/layouts_index.json` | Query available page layout templates |
| Visualization templates | `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/charts/charts_index.json` | Query available visualization SVG templates (charts, infographics, diagrams, frameworks) |
| Icon library | `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/icons/` | See `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/icons/README.md`; search icons on demand with `ls templates/icons/<library>/ \| grep <keyword>` |

## Standalone Workflows

| Workflow | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `create-template` | `workflows/create-template.md` | Standalone template creation workflow |
| `verify-charts` | `workflows/verify-charts.md` | Chart coordinate calibration — run after SVG generation if the deck contains data charts |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Source Content Processing

🚧 **GATE**: User has provided source material (PDF / DOCX / EPUB / URL / Markdown file / text description / conversation content — any form is acceptable).

When the user provides non-Markdown content, convert immediately:

| User Provides | Command |
|---------------|---------|
| PDF file | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/pdf_to_md.py <file>` |
| DOCX / Word / Office document | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/doc_to_md.py <file>` |
| XLSX / XLSM / Excel workbook | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/excel_to_md.py <file>` |
| CSV / TSV | Read directly as plain-text table source |
| PPTX / PowerPoint deck | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/ppt_to_md.py <file>` |
| EPUB / HTML / LaTeX / RST / other | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/doc_to_md.py <file>` |
| Web link | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/web_to_md.py <URL>` |
| WeChat / high-security site | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md/web_to_md.py <URL>` (requires `curl_cffi`; falls back to `node web_to_md.cjs <URL>` only if that package is unavailable) |
| Markdown | Read directly |

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm source content is ready, proceed to Step 2.**

---

### Step 2: Project Initialization

🚧 **GATE**: Step 1 complete; source content is ready (Markdown file, user-provided text, or requirements described in conversation are all valid).

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> --format <format>
```

Format options: `ppt169` (default), `ppt43`, `xhs`, `story`, etc. For the full format list, see `references/canvas-formats.md`.

Import source content (choose based on the situation):

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Has source files (PDF/MD/etc.) | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py import-sources <project_path> <source_files...> --move` |
| User provided text directly in conversation | No import needed — content is already in conversation context; subsequent steps can reference it directly |

> ⚠️ **MUST use `--move`** (not copy): all source files — Step 1's generated Markdown, original PDFs / MDs / images — go into `sources/` via `import-sources --move`. After execution they no longer exist at the original location. Intermediate artifacts (e.g., `_files/`) are handled automatically.

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm project structure created successfully, `sources/` contains all source files, converted materials are ready. Proceed to Step 3.**

---

### Step 3: Template Option

🚧 **GATE**: Step 2 complete; project directory structure is ready.

**Default — free design.** Proceed directly to Step 4. Do NOT query `layouts_index.json`. Do NOT ask the user an A/B template-vs-free-design question.

**Template flow is opt-in.** Enter it only when an explicit trigger appears in the user's prior messages:

1. Names a specific template (e.g., "用 mckinsey 模板" / "use the academic_defense template")
2. Names a style / brand reference that maps to a template (e.g., "McKinsey 那种" / "Google style" / "学术答辩样式")
3. Asks what templates exist (e.g., "有哪些模板可以用")

When triggered: read `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/layouts_index.json`, resolve the match (or list options for trigger 3), and copy:

```bash
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/*.svg <project_path>/templates/
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/design_spec.md <project_path>/templates/
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/*.png <project_path>/images/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp ${SKILL_DIR}/templates/layouts/<template_name>/*.jpg <project_path>/images/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Soft hint (non-blocking).** When content is an obvious strong match for an existing template (e.g., academic defense, government report, McKinsey-style deck) AND no template trigger fired, emit a single-sentence notice and continue without waiting:

> Note: the library has a template `<name>` that matches this scenario closely. Say the word if you want to use it; otherwise I'll continue with free design.

Hint, not question — do NOT block. Skip entirely on weak/ambiguous match.

> To create a new global template, read `workflows/create-template.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — Default path proceeds to Step 4 without user interaction. If a template trigger fired, template files are copied before advancing.**

---

### Step 4: Strategist Phase (MANDATORY — cannot be skipped)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 3 complete; default free-design path taken, or (if triggered) template files copied into the project.

First, read the role definition:
```
Read references/strategist.md
```

> ⚠️ **Mandatory gate**: before writing `design_spec.md`, Strategist MUST `read_file templates/design_spec_reference.md` and follow its full I–XI section structure. See `strategist.md` Section 1.

**Eight Confirmations** (full template: `templates/design_spec_reference.md`):

⛔ **BLOCKING**: present the Eight Confirmations as a bundled recommendation set and **wait for explicit user confirmation or modification** before outputting Design Specification & Content Outline. This is the single core confirmation point — once confirmed, all subsequent steps proceed automatically.

1. Canvas format
2. Page count range
3. Target audience
4. Style objective
5. Color scheme
6. Icon usage approach
7. Typography plan
8. Image usage approach

If the user provided images, run analysis **before outputting the design spec**:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images
```

> ⚠️ **Image handling**: NEVER directly read / open / view image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.). All image info comes from `analyze_images.py` output or the Design Spec's Image Resource List.

**Output**:
- `<project_path>/design_spec.md` — human-readable design narrative
- `<project_path>/spec_lock.md` — machine-readable execution contract (skeleton: `templates/spec_lock_reference.md`); Executor re-reads before every page

**✅ Checkpoint — Phase deliverables complete, auto-proceed to next step**:
```markdown
## ✅ Strategist Phase Complete
- [x] Eight Confirmations completed (user confirmed)
- [x] Design Specification & Content Outline generated
- [x] Execution lock (spec_lock.md) generated
- [ ] **Next**: Auto-proceed to [Image_Generator / Executor] phase
```

---

### Step 5: Image_Generator Phase (Conditional)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 complete; Design Specification & Content Outline generated and user confirmed.

> **Trigger**: Image approach includes "AI generation". Otherwise skip to Step 6.

Read `references/image-generator.md`

1. Extract all images with status `Pending` from the design spec
2. Generate prompt document → `<project_path>/images/image_prompts.md`
3. Generate images (CLI tool recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_gen.py "prompt" --aspect_ratio 16:9 --image_size 1K -o <project_path>/images
   ```

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm image generation attempted for every row, proceed to Step 6**:
```markdown
## ✅ Image_Generator Phase Complete
- [x] Prompt document created
- [x] Each image: status is either `Generated` (file present in images/) or `Needs-Manual` (reported to user with filename + reason)
- [x] No row remains `Pending`
```

> On generation failure, do NOT halt — follow the Failure Handling rule in `references/image-generator.md` §4.3: retry once, then mark the row `Needs-Manual`, report to user, and continue to Step 6.

---

### Step 6: Executor Phase

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 (and Step 5 if triggered) complete; all prerequisite deliverables are ready.

Read the role definition based on the selected style:
```
Read references/executor-base.md          # REQUIRED: common guidelines
Read references/shared-standards.md       # REQUIRED: SVG/PPT technical constraints
Read references/executor-general.md       # General flexible style
Read references/executor-consultant.md    # Consulting style
Read references/executor-consultant-top.md # Top consulting style (MBB level)
```

> Only read executor-base + shared-standards + one style file.

**Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, output key design parameters from the spec (canvas dimensions, color scheme, font plan, body font size). See executor-base.md §2.

**Per-page spec_lock re-read (Mandatory)**: before **each** SVG page, `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md` and use only its colors / fonts / icons / images. Resists context-compression drift on long decks. See executor-base.md §2.1.

> ⚠️ **Main-agent only**: SVG generation MUST stay in the current main agent — page design depends on full upstream context. Do NOT delegate to sub-agents.
> ⚠️ **Generation rhythm**: generate pages sequentially, one at a time, in the same continuous context. Do NOT batch (e.g., 5 per group).

**Visual Construction Phase**: generate SVG pages sequentially, one at a time, in one continuous pass → `<project_path>/svg_output/`

**Quality Check Gate (Mandatory)** — after all SVGs, BEFORE speaker notes:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path>
```
- Any `error` (banned SVG features, viewBox mismatch, spec_lock drift, etc.) MUST be fixed before proceeding — return to Visual Construction, regenerate that page, re-run check.
- `warning` entries (low-res image, non-PPT-safe font tail, etc.): fix when straightforward, otherwise acknowledge and release.
- Run against `svg_output/` (not after `finalize_svg.py` — finalize rewrites SVG and masks violations).

**Logic Construction Phase**: generate speaker notes → `<project_path>/notes/total.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm all SVGs and notes are fully generated and quality-checked. Proceed directly to Step 7 post-processing**:
```markdown
## ✅ Executor Phase Complete
- [x] All SVGs generated to svg_output/
- [x] svg_quality_checker.py passed (0 errors)
- [x] Speaker notes generated at notes/total.md
```

> **Chart pages?** If this deck contains data charts (bar / line / pie / radar / etc.), run the standalone [`verify-charts`](workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow before Step 7 to calibrate coordinates. AI models routinely introduce 10–50 px errors when mapping data to pixel positions; verify-charts eliminates that class of error. Skip if no chart pages.

---

### Step 7: Post-processing & Export

🚧 **GATE**: Step 6 complete; all SVGs generated to `svg_output/`; speaker notes `notes/total.md` generated.

> ⚠️ Run the three sub-steps **one at a time** — each must complete successfully before the next.
> ❌ **NEVER** combine them into a single code block or shell invocation.

Canonical three-command pipeline (mirrors `references/shared-standards.md` §5):

**Step 7.1** — Split speaker notes:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
```

**Step 7.2** — SVG post-processing (icon embedding / image crop & embed / text flattening / rounded rect to path):
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
```

**Step 7.3** — Export PPTX (embeds speaker notes by default):
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> -s final
# Output:
#   exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx           ← main native pptx
#   backup/<timestamp>/<project_name>_svg.pptx        ← SVG snapshot
#   backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/                    ← Executor SVG source backup
```

**Optional animation flags** (the defaults already enable rich entrance animations — adjust only when the user asks for something different):
- `-t <effect>` — page transition. Default `fade`. Options: `fade` / `push` / `wipe` / `split` / `strips` / `cover` / `random` / `none`.
- `-a <effect>` — per-element entrance animation. Default `mixed` (auto-vary across the deck). Pass `none` to disable, or pick a specific effect like `fade`. Requires top-level `<g id="...">` groups (already required by Executor).
- `--animation-trigger {on-click,with-previous,after-previous}` — Start mode (matches PowerPoint's animation-pane Start dropdown). Default `after-previous` (click-free cascade; pace via `--animation-stagger`). Use `on-click` for presenter-paced reveals, or `with-previous` for all-at-once.
- `--auto-advance <seconds>` — kiosk-style auto-play.

**Optional recorded narration** (only when the user asks for narrated/video export):

Run the standalone [`generate-audio`](workflows/generate-audio.md) workflow. The AI picks voice candidates from the locale-filtered `edge-tts` catalog, asks the user once (voice + rate + embed-or-not, all with recommended values), then executes `notes_to_audio.py` and (if chosen) re-exports the PPTX with `--recorded-narration audio`.

Do NOT call `notes_to_audio.py` directly without going through the workflow — `--voice` is required and the workflow produces the locale-aware recommendation that makes the choice meaningful.

Full effect list, anchor logic, and limits: [`references/animations.md`](references/animations.md).

> ❌ **NEVER** substitute `cp` for `finalize_svg.py` — finalize performs multiple critical processing steps
> ❌ **NEVER** export from `svg_output/` — MUST use `-s final` (exports from `svg_final/`)
> ❌ **NEVER** use `--only` (it suppresses one of the two output files)
