Drop in a PDF, DOCX, URL, or Markdown — get back a **natively editable PowerPoint** with real shapes, real text boxes, and real charts. Not images. Click anything and edit it.

> **Animations** — exported decks support **page transitions** and **per-element entrance animations** as real OOXML, not embedded video. By default, elements cascade in automatically on slide entry — no clicking needed. Plays natively in PowerPoint and Keynote, no extra tooling. See [Animations & Transitions →](./skills/ppt-master/references/animations.md).

> **Narration & Video** — generate per-slide voice narration from the speaker notes (`edge-tts` by default, optional cloud TTS providers for high-quality or cloned voices), embed the audio back into the PPTX, and let PowerPoint export the deck as an MP4 video — synced narration + transitions, no third-party tools. See [Audio Narration & Video Export →](./docs/audio-narration.md).

> **How it works** — PPT Master is a workflow (a "skill") that works inside AI IDEs like Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, or Codebuddy. You chat with the AI — "make a deck from this PDF" — and it follows the workflow to produce a real editable `.pptx` on your computer. No coding on your side; the IDE is just where the conversation happens.
>
> **What you'll do**: install Python, install an AI IDE, drop in your material.

PPT Master is different:

- **Real PowerPoint** — if a file can't be opened and edited in PowerPoint, it shouldn't be called a PPT. Every element PPT Master outputs is directly clickable and editable
- **Transparent, predictable cost** — the tool is free and open source; the only cost is your AI model usage. As AI tools move to usage-based billing, you pay exactly what you consume — no separate PPT subscription added on top
- **Data stays local** — your files shouldn't have to be uploaded to someone else's server just to make a presentation. Apart from AI model communication, the entire pipeline runs on your machine
- **No platform lock-in** — your workflow shouldn't be held hostage by any single company. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and more; supports Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, and other models

AI presentation tools roughly fall into four categories. PPT Master only does the last one:

| Category | Output | Editable element-by-element in PowerPoint? |
|---|---|:---:|
| Template fill-in | PPTX built from a fixed template | Partially — limited by the template |
| Image-based | One large image per slide, packed into PPTX | ❌ each slide is a picture |
| HTML presentation | Web-based deck | ❌ not a PPTX |
| **Native editable (PPT Master)** | **Real DrawingML shapes, text boxes, charts** | ✅ click any element to edit |

## Built by Hugo He

I'm a finance professional (CPA · CPV · Consulting Engineer (Investment)) who regularly reviews and edits presentation decks. I wanted AI-generated slides to remain editable in PowerPoint, not flattened into images — so I built this.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**You only need Python.** Everything else is installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

| Dependency | Required? | What it does |
|------------|:---------:|--------------|
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+ | ✅ **Yes** | Core runtime — the only thing you actually need to install |

> **TL;DR** — Install Python, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and you're ready to generate presentations.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong> — see the dedicated step-by-step guide ⚠️</summary>

Windows requires a few extra steps (PATH setup, execution policy, etc.). We wrote a **step-by-step guide** specifically for Windows users:

**📖 [Windows Installation Guide](./docs/windows-installation.md)** — from zero to a working presentation in 10 minutes.

Quick version: download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) → **check "Add to PATH"** during install → `pip install -r requirements.txt` → done.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS / Linux</strong> — install and go</summary>

```bash
# macOS
brew install python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Edge-case fallbacks</strong> — 99% of users don't need these</summary>

Two external tools exist as fallbacks for edge cases. **Most users will never need them** — install only if you hit one of the specific scenarios below.

| Fallback | Install only if… |
|----------|-----------------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ | You need to import WeChat Official Account articles **and** `curl_cffi` (part of `requirements.txt`) has no prebuilt wheel for your Python + OS + CPU combination. In normal setups `web_to_md.py` handles WeChat directly through `curl_cffi`. |
| [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) | You need to convert legacy formats: `.doc`, `.odt`, `.rtf`, `.tex`, `.rst`, `.org`, or `.typ`. `.docx`, `.html`, `.epub`, `.ipynb` are handled natively by Python — no pandoc required. |

```bash
# macOS (only if the above conditions apply)
brew install node
brew install pandoc

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install nodejs npm
sudo apt install pandoc
```
</details>

### 2. Pick an Agent

PPT Master runs in **any tool with agent capability** — read/write files, execute commands, and sustain multi-turn conversation.

| Type | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **IDE-native agent** | • VS Code architecture ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) itself, plus forks & derivatives): [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), Trae, Codebuddy IDE, [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), Void, etc.<br>• Other architectures: [Zed](https://zed.dev/), etc. | Editor with a built-in agent |
| **IDE plugin / extension** | [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (VS Code / JetBrains extension), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [Continue](https://continue.dev/), Roo Code, etc. | Installed inside hosts like VS Code or JetBrains |
| **CLI agent** | [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI, [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Aider](https://aider.chat/), Gemini CLI, etc. | Runs in the terminal; suits scripting, remote, or server use |

> **Model recommendation**: [Claude](https://claude.ai/) Opus / Sonnet works best and is most tested. Other mainstream models (GPT, Gemini, Kimi, MiniMax, etc.) also work, but SVG absolute-coordinate layout precision varies.

**🔑 Want to use Claude / GPT / Gemini but don't have access yet?** Project sponsor **[PackyCode](https://www.packyapi.com/register?aff=ppt-master)** can help — whether you lack an API key, can't connect directly, have no way to subscribe, or just don't want to pay a full monthly fee for occasional use, PackyCode lets you call Claude, GPT, Gemini and more on a pay-as-you-go basis, no subscription required. Enter promo code **`ppt-master`** when topping up for 10% off.

### 3. Set Up

**Option A — Download ZIP** (no Git required): click **Code → Download ZIP** on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master), then unzip.

**Option B — Git clone** (requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master.git
cd ppt-master
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To update later (Option B only): `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/update_repo.py`

### 4. Create

**Provide source materials (recommended):** Place your PDF, DOCX, images, or other files in the `projects/` directory, then tell the AI chat panel which files to use. The quickest way to get the path: right-click the file in your file manager or IDE sidebar → **Copy Path** (or **Copy Relative Path**) and paste it directly into the chat.

```
You: Please create a PPT from projects/q3-report/sources/report.pdf
```

**Paste content directly:** You can also paste text content straight into the chat window and the AI will generate a PPT from it.

```
You: Please turn the following into a PPT: [paste your content here...]
```

Either way, the AI will first confirm the design spec:

```
AI:  Sure. Let's confirm the design spec:
     [Template] B) Free design
     [Format]   PPT 16:9
     [Pages]    8-10 pages
     ...
```

The AI handles everything — content analysis, visual design, SVG generation, and PPTX export.

> **Output:** Main native-shapes `.pptx` (directly editable) saved to `exports/<name>_<timestamp>.pptx`. The SVG snapshot `_svg.pptx` and a copy of `svg_output/` are archived to `backup/<timestamp>/` for visual reference and pptx rebuild without re-running the LLM. Requires Office 2016+.

> **AI lost context?** Ask it to read `skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`.

> **Something went wrong?** Check the **[FAQ](./docs/faq.md)** — it covers model selection, layout issues, export problems, and more. Continuously updated from real user reports.

### 5. Image Acquisition (Optional)

Two paths for non-user images, mixable per row in the same deck:

**A) AI generation** — `image_gen.py`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set `IMAGE_BACKEND` plus the provider's `*_API_KEY` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.), and the pipeline calls it automatically. Run `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/image_gen.py --list-backends` for the full backend list. `gpt-image-2` is currently the best default.

**B) Web image search** — `image_search.py`. **Zero-config works**, but configure `PEXELS_API_KEY` / `PIXABAY_API_KEY` (both free) for higher-quality results. Without keys, search uses Openverse / Wikimedia Commons only; this is useful as a fallback, but image quality can be uneven because many results are ordinary user uploads. With keys, the default provider chain also appends Pexels / Pixabay, which materially improves modern stock photography, people, workplace, lifestyle, and illustration coverage. The default is quality-first: CC0, Public Domain, Pexels / Pixabay no-attribution licenses, CC BY, and CC BY-SA are considered together, and Executor adds a small inline credit whenever the selected image requires attribution. Use `--strict-no-attribution` only when a slide cannot tolerate any credit line. For high-impact covers, product shots, portraits, and branded scenes, prefer this order: user-provided high-resolution assets / AI generation > web search with Pexels / Pixabay keys > zero-config web search.
